A fully functional Arduino-based prototype designed for the Ride Engineering Competition 2024, showcasing a dual gondola amusement ride system. The project integrates embedded systems, custom motor control, and mechanical design to simulate the movement and lighting behavior of a theme park ride.

# Project Overview
This project was developed as part of a competitive team challenge to build a scale model of a dual gondola ride. The ride is controlled through an Arduino Mega and features:
* Motor Synchronization for gondola movement
* RFID System for rider identification and access control
* Interactive LED Lighting to simulate ride ambiance
* LCD Display Interface for status updates
* Servo-based Mechanisms for access gates and effects

# Features
* LED Effects: Multi-zone RGB lighting
* RFID Integration: MFRC522 for access control
* Motors: For mechanical actions like gates and effects
* LCD Display: I2C interface for live status
* Start/Stop Buttons for manual control
